title: How to control Glass with Myo using WearScript
layout: post
---

As of the last time I did this, these were the necessary steps

##  Connect Glass to an Android Phone

* There needs to be a Bluetooth connection
* MyGlass needs to recognize the Glass, and you should be able to control Glass with gestures on the screencast.


## Kill MyGlass services

* Open "running apps" in settings, view details of MyGlass, and kill the services individually. I think one of them is the critical one, but I don't know how to tell which.

## Run WearScript on the phone only

You need the Myo-enabled distribution of WearScript.

Run this gist:

The Myo should be green to begin with, you don't need to pair it beforehand.
