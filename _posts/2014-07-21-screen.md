title: My setup for GNU Screen layouts
layout: post
---

I tend to suffer from tab proliferation in the Terminal.

Using GNU Screen helps mitigate this to some degree. Today I was excited to take my setup one step further: preserving split window layouts.

In case you weren't aware, you can split any `screen` session vertically or
horizontally, just as you might an Emacs session. `Ctrl-A Shift-S` splits
vertically, and `Ctrl-A Shift-\` splits horizontally. When you detach `screen`,
however, the layout disappears. A technique that fixes this is to nest one
session inside another session. There are a number of ways to set up the details,
and I'm going to tell you the one that I just settled on.

I'm using two initialization files, `.screenrc` and `.screenrc.outer`. I fire up
my outer session with `screen -c ~/.screenrc.outer` and then fire up an inner
session with `screen -m`. The main thing to be aware of is that you need to
detach the outer session instead of the inner one. So I definited two different
escape sequences. both are different from the default of `Ctrl-a`. That default
plays very badly with emacs. So for the inner session I opted for `Ctrl-\`, and
for the outer one, `Ctrl-^`. When detaching, just make sure to use `Ctrl-^ d`.
