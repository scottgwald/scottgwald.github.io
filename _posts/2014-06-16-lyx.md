title: Adding a latex template to lyx
---

# Steps

* Load the new layout into the tex system. On my system, put the `.cls` file in
`/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base` and run `texmf` or `texhash` or whatever. Reference
[my tumblr post](http://scottgwald.tumblr.com/post/67048241525/texlive-package-manager-listing-packages).

* Make a minimal lyx `.layout` file that maps latex syntactic environments 
  to lyx visual environments.

* Put the `.layout` file in a place Lyx can find it, in my case `~/Library/Application\ Support/LyX-2.1/layouts`

* Reload / reconfigure Lyx

* Done

# How to 

* **find the location of layouts recognized by the latex system**

    `kpsewhich article.cls`

* **location of layout files that are part of the LyX distribution**

    `/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/layouts`

e.g. `stdsections.inc`
