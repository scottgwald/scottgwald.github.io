title: A gotcha on GitHub, diffs, and PRs
layout: post
---

This was a nuanced situation, and it forced me, with Blake's help,
to learn something new about PR's on GitHub. 

The goal was to review a
[PR](https://github.com/kurtisnelson/wearscript-android/pull/2) from Kurt on
his upstream-dev branch. He had apparently tested this on Glass XE18.3,
because when I checked it out and ran it on XE19.1, it was broken. The branch
`upstream-dev` however, was not broken, because it contained [this fix](https:
//github.com/kurtisnelson/wearscript-android/commit/d52bdae0cb0a4649941adc9f87
dcd6b3e0773abe). Looking only at what was displayed in the "Files Changed"
view of the PR, however, did not reveal that difference. So the subtlety is
that GitHub shows just the contents of the patchset, not the full diff between
the source branch and the current target branch.

## Conclusion

The implication of this is that, before merging any PR on GitHub, you need to
merge it locally with the target branch and build it. It's not enough just to
check out the source branch and test it, because that is not what you'll end
up with if you merge the PR. In general the burden should be on the submitter
to be as close as possible to the target branch when submitting. However, even
with the best of habits and intentions, the present situation is certain to
arise on occasion.
